Speech-To-Text Acoustics Model

1.  Background
Modern day speech-to-text services are built using a corpus of general, everyday words and pronuciations 
that works well for common conversation, however, when technology is being utilized in industry specific environments, 
transcribing unique accents or uncommon dialect, the ability to utilize the machine learning capabiltities in IBM Watson 
provides training custom Speech-To-Text models (Language & Acoustic) so as to more accurately align with highly specialized, 
industry-specific terminology and jargon achieving a higher degree of accuracy.

Teams working to train Speech-to-Text Models for Custom Language Models and Acoustic Models will need to do the following steps in Development as well as Production as currently there is not a supported vehicle for moving fully trained models from Development to Production.   


Replace {username} and {password} in the commands below with the appropriate credentials for the Speech-To-Text service instance.  If using Identity and Access Management (IAM) API Key, replace {username}:{password} with “apikey:{apikey}” where {apikey} is the IAM API Key value for the Speech-To-Text service instance.
    	

2.  Create a Custom Speech-to-Text Acoustics Model

curl -X POST -u "{username}:{password}"
--header "Content-Type: application/json"
--data "{\"name\": \"Example acoustic model\",
  \"base_model_name\": \"en-US_BroadbandModel\",
  \"description\": \"Example custom acoustic model\"}"
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations"

[Note:  returns a unique "customization_id" ]

3.  Add Audio Training Data to Custom Acoustics Model using a WAV File
CUSTOMIZATION_ID=<customization id returned when creating custom model>
AUDIO_FILE=< wav file containing training data>
AUDIO_NAME=<naming convention used to identify audio training data - i.e. AudioDataV1 
curl -X POST -u "{username}:{password}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/wav"
--data-binary @{AUDIO_FILE}.wav
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/audio/{AUDIO_NAME}"

Note:  A MINIMUM of 10 minutes and a MAXIMUM of 50 hours of audio that includes speech (not silence) must be used to train a valid Custom Acoustics Model

Add Achive-type Audio to  Custom Acoustic Model
curl -X POST -u "{username}:{password}"
--header "Content-Type: application/zip"
--header "Contained-Content-Type: audio/l16;rate=16000"
--data-binary @{AUDIO_FILE}.zip
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/audio/{AUDIO_NAME}"

 
 4.  Train Custom Acoustics Model
This step is required to run after any upload of data from a WAV file or Archive-type File.  If this is not run, the data uploaded will not be available for use by the Custom STT model.
 
curl -X POST -u "{username}:{password}"
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}/train"
  
  Note:  depending upon amount of data provided for training, can take mins or several hours


5.  Validate Training Completion

curl -X GET -u "{username}:{password}"
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}"

6.  Delete Custom Language Model

curl -X DELETE -u "{username}:{password}"
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/acoustic_customizations/{customization_id}"
